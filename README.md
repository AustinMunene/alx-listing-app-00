# ALX Listing App

A modern Airbnb clone listing page built with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. This project scaffolds a production-ready, scalable codebase with a clean folder structure, reusable components, and best practices for maintainability and extensibility.

## Project Structure

- `components/common/` – Reusable UI components (e.g., Card, Button)
- `interfaces/` – TypeScript interfaces for props and data models
- `constants/` – Project-wide constants (API URLs, config, UI text, etc.)
- `public/assets/` – Images and SVGs used throughout the app
- `pages/` – Next.js Pages Router for routing and main page(s)
- `styles/globals.css` – TailwindCSS base, components, and utilities

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
3. **Open your browser:**
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Goals
- Production-ready Next.js setup (Pages Router, no src/ directory)
- TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- TailwindCSS for responsive, accessible UI
- ESLint for code quality
- Clean, scalable folder structure
- Foundational reusable components
